## Task 05: EDA on traffic accident data

**📄 Description**

  For my fifth task, i was assigned to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors. I selected the **Road Traffic Accidents** dataset from Kaggle.
  The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accident of the year 2017-20. All the sensitive information have been excluded during data encoding and finally it has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. Then it is preprocessed
  and for identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms algorithms. RTA Dataset.csv is the dataset before preprocessing and cleaned.csv is the preprocessed dataset.
  
**📚 Dataset**  
  Sample Dataset: Road Traffic Accidents dataset from kaggle.

**📚 Libraries Used 🔧**  
- 🐍 Pandas
  - Purpose: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - Usage: To handle and process data, including reading and cleaning the dataset.

- 📊 Seaborn
  - Purpose: Statistical data visualization.
  - Usage: To create informative and attractive visualizations such as histograms, pair plots, and violin plots.

- 🖼️ Matplotlib
  - Purpose: Plotting and visualization.
  - Usage: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations, including histograms and plots with customized styles.
